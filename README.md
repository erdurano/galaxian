# Space Invaders clone given on Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes

It is pretty fun to play with, and with an added benefit of being written in Python.

For easy recreation of the running environment I used Pipenv. Thus you can clone the repository and can run

```
pipenv sync
```

It's pretty obvious if you're familiar with Pipenv. But if you are not, don't sweat. If you have a working python3 and pip it is just another step before afore mentioned.

If you have the environment ready, you can run the game with

```
pipenv run python alien_invasion.py
```

That's it. It is simple, it is fun. and it was a learner's project. Please judge it just by that.
